            Online marketing and ad-tech is a privacy nightmare. Google
            Analytics and other trackers follow you on each step around the web
            and collect information on your behavior. For website owners, the
            dashboard is frustrating to use, hard to understand, and slow. Data
            gets less reliable, as plugins and browsers start to take matters
            into their own hands, blocking invasive scripts by default.

          <p className="mt-4 text-[1.375rem] leading-normal text-pir-gray-500">
            We set out to solve that problem with a privacy-focused,
            open-source, and easy-to-integrate solution. Pirsch respects your
            visitors' privacy. It never tracks them across websites nor collects
            uniquely identifiable information. It offers an efficient dashboard
            to provide actionable, aggregated statistics.
